      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      I actually had a really solid early life. My parents are fantastic, and
      always worked as hard as they could to ensure that my siblings and I had
      everything we needed. My younger sister has special needs, and while that
      was definetely a stressor, my parents never let us know how hard it was
      for them. I had a lot of varied interests as a kid, and my parents did
      their best to encourage them. <br />
      <br />
      In high school they encouraged me to start looking around for colleges,
      and start thinking about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I
      had a lot of ideas....

      <h2>Now</h2>
      <p>
        That extensive background brings us to today. It's been a long, oftentimes difficult road,
        but I'm proud that I've made it this far. To be honest, it's kind of odd looking towards 
        the future when I've spent so long not thinking I'd make it this far.

        Right now my career goals are somewhat ambiguous.
